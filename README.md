# 📦 Inventory Management Automation

## 📋 Problem Statement

Manual data entry and inefficient communication are significant challenges in inventory management, leading to:

1. **Manual Data Entry** ✍️
    - Staff are required to manually key in "Current Stock Level," "Last Order Date," and "Last Received Date."
    - Copy supplier orders manually into a new sheet.
    - High potential for human error leading to inaccurate inventory levels.
    - Time-consuming process that diverts staff from more strategic tasks.

2. **Inefficient Communication** 📧
    - Staff must manually calculate reorder quantities and send emails to suppliers.
    - Delays in communication can lead to late orders and disruptions in the supply chain.
    - Lack of automation means critical reorder notifications can be missed, leading to stock shortages.

3. **Wastage of Resources** ⏳
    - Significant time spent on routine tasks like data entry, monitoring stock levels, and reordering.
    - Inefficient use of staff resources that could be better utilized in more value-added activities.

## 🛠️ Solution

This project aims to automate these processes using Google Apps Script and Google Sheets to:

1. Automatically update and manage inventory levels.
2. Calculate reorder quantities and send automated emails to suppliers.
3. Generate reports and notifications to prevent stock shortages and excesses.
4. Enhance communication and reduce human error in data entry and order processing.
